# Journal

# Class 1

Hour 1: Began to read through the Introduction to Command Line on GitHub. It was helpful to go through and reiterate what we discussed in class. I also practiced accessing the command line on my Mac. I know that’s pretty basic, but I am starting at the beginning with all of this, so I definitely have a long way to go and learn. 

Hour 2: Kept making my way through the Introduction to Command. Got slightly distracted trying to find the right color background. I went with Pro (lol), but I also liked Novel. Continued on with practicing the basic codes we learned and navigated through my files. 

Hour 3: I played around with more ofl the commands we learned. At first, I got cat and echo confused and kept getting frustrated. Fortunately, I quickly learned the error of my ways and then continued on. I kept reading files on my desktop with cat. 

Hour 4-6: Practiced moving files around and creating new files. I think I may actually be getting this?!?!/Feel like things are slightly less scary and starting to be kind of fun. I have a lot of fear and anxiety with programming so I’m excited to have this revolation. 

# Class 2

Hour 1 & 2: Created a journal file. Struggled to remember how to push a file to git.hub. Tried for a few hours before looking at notes or other instructions. After a bit I broke down I decided to look at instructions. 

Hour 3: Tried to push a file to git.hub using instructions and got several error messages. Ugh. Why. 

Hour 4: Got frustrated because my file would not push and decided to come back to hacking at a later date. 

# Class 3

Hour 1: Decided to stop trying to push my file to git.hub and open it in VS code since I could not figure out how to do it. Downloaded Anaconda and began the command line crash course. 

Hour 2-4: Worked through the command line crash course. At first things went great and I felt like I was really getting it! (yey) After some time I got stuck in a few places. I’m having a hard time getting the pushd and popd commands, but overall I think I may be starting to get it!

# Class 4

Hour 1-3: Played around in python for a bit with looping. I think I'm getting it?!?!??!

Hour 3-6: Tried very hard to figure out how to push my journal to git hub. It will not work and I am screaming. It's time to walk away from the computer. 

# Class 5

Hours 1-6: For all my hours this week I played around in Python. I'm really excited about learning Python and I feel like I'm actually finally starting to get it. I feel like my anxiety has definitely been getting better related to coding. I feel pretty comfortable with building the if and else conditions and have started really enjoying writing out a program (can I call it that now?!!?!?!). Looking forward to doing more with python in class this week. 

# Class 6 7 8

I am going to be honest, my ability to keep up with coding has fallen on the wayside since the Coronavirus has spread throughout the United States. While I am excited about coding and have thoroughly enjoyed attending class, I have found myself really struggling to do outside homework during this time. Between concerns about job security to the thought of getting or spreading the virus myself, to fears of my loved ones catching the virus and losing their lives, my energy has been spent trying to practice self-care and keep myself together. Overall, I've been trying to limit the time that I spend on my computer and phone, as to avoid looking up content about the Coronavirus and overwhelm myself. 

I haven't stopped thinking about coding however. It's been interesting to see how numerous students across the United States have started to create websites to track the virus. Here is a public website created by college students in the Virginia area: https://www.trackcorona.live/ . This website includes an interactive map to track the virus by country, state and even county, along with a lot of other helpful information. I like that this site discloses funders, pageviews, etc.  Additionally, a self taught coder from Washington state who is currently a 17 year old junior in high school created this site to track the virus: https://ncov2019.live/data . This site pulls the data from around the world to show the number of people inflected, those who have been killed, those who have recovered, etc. in an accessible format. Seeing these websites pop up, with their creation by students, has really made me consider the power of coding to create public resources and provide important data in an accessible manner. Thinking back to the history of coding that we learned in class, it's exciting to see people stepping up and creating free and credible resources and I feel like the coding community would be pleased with this sort of public service. 

The past few days I've started to get into a routine and back into coding. It's been slow and steady, but I'm trying to use the inspiration from the students who have been creating websites to track the virus to motivate me to get back into it. I've started out re-reading my notes from all the classes we've had thus far, playing with the command line and dabbling a bit with python to ready myself for the next class. I hope that everyone is staying safe and is doing okay. I miss going to class every week and seeing everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed learning coding in the classroom and in person, however I am adjusting to these changes and trying to put my best foot forward. I wish you all the best. 

# Class 9

For this week I spent my hours reviewing the code from last week and considering what I may do for my final project. 

Overall, I think I generally understand the code from last week, with the exception of the second part. The first part makes logical sense to me, it's when I get to the r=requests.get.url that I started to get lost. I want to understand why we wanted to pull the html and how that helped us with our tasks. I hope that this is clarified within the text class. 

For the final project: I have a couple of different ideas for what I'd like to do. I've decided that I'd like to do something with python, so I've been thinking about project option 1 or 2. The idea of project 1 appeals to me because I'd like to write about my experience utilizing python for a task in an accessible and not intiminating way. As a person who has been (and continues to be a little) intiminated by coding, I feel like it would be great to write something from my perspective that could help ease the minds of other new coders. I'm continuing to explore my options, but I like the way that the final assignments have been presented. 

# Class 10

For this week's hours I further thought about my final project and began to go through the creating web API's with Python and Flask lesson that Patrick sent for homework. 

For my final project, I have mentioned in class that I would like to create a program in Python to pull data from Qualtrics and sort it for the pre and post test data that I need for a monthly report for work. This week, I needed to complete the monthly report manually, so I was able to take another look at what I would want the program to do. Essentially, there are 16 courses that need both pre and post test data to be pulled from Qualtrics. Ideally, I would also like to sort out columns that I don't need in order to streamline the process and make it less manual (there are several columns that I don't need to include in the final report that I sent). There are only 7 columns that I need to keep in the pre/post tests for the final reports. An additional bonus would be putting the pre-test and post test spreadsheets together for all the 16 courses so that I don't have to do that manually as well. I don't know if that would be possible within the scope of this course/my limited abilities so please feel free to respond/discuss with me. 

Additionally, this week I took a look at the Creating Web API's with Python and Flask lesson that Patrick sent for homework. In the next two weeks, I plan to continue looking more closely that these lessons to help with my final project.
