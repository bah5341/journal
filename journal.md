Class 1

Hour 1: Began to read through the Introduction to Command Line on GitHub. It was helpful to go through and reiterate what we discussed in class. I also practiced accessing the command line on my Mac. I know that’s pretty basic, but I am starting at the beginning with all of this, so I definitely have a long way to go and learn. 

Hour 2: Kept making my way through the Introduction to Command. Got slightly distracted trying to find the right color background. I went with Pro (lol), but I also liked Novel. Continued on with practicing the basic codes we learned and navigated through my files. 

Hour 3: I played around with more ofl the commands we learned. At first, I got cat and echo confused and kept getting frustrated. Fortunately, I quickly learned the error of my ways and then continued on. I kept reading files on my desktop with cat. 

Hour 4-6: Practiced moving files around and creating new files. I think I may actually be getting this?!?!/Feel like things are slightly less scary and starting to be kind of fun. I have a lot of fear and anxiety with programming so I’m excited to have this revolation. 

Class 2

Hour 1 & 2: Created a journal file. Struggled to remember how to push a file to git.hub. Tried for a few hours before looking at notes or other instructions. After a bit I broke down I decided to look at instructions. 

Hour 3: Tried to push a file to git.hub using instructions and got several error messages. Ugh. Why. 

Hour 4: Got frustrated because my file would not push and decided to come back to hacking at a later date. 

Class 3

Hour 1: Decided to stop trying to push my file to git.hub and open it in VS code since I could not figure out how to do it. Downloaded Anaconda and began the command line crash course. 

Hour 2-4: Worked through the command line crash course. At first things went great and I felt like I was really getting it! (yey) After some time I got stuck in a few places. I’m having a hard time getting the pushd and popd commands, but overall I think I may be starting to get it!

Class 4

Hour 1-3: Played around in python for a bit with looping. I think I'm getting it?!?!??!

Hour 3-6: Tried very hard to figure out how to push my journal to git hub. It will not work and I am screaming. It's time to walk away from the computer.
